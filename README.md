# The technical task

Develop a system for automatically detecting and tracking a given object on a video with its definition
locations (x, y, z â€“ 3D coordinates).

# Implementation

The problem can be divided into two tasks: Develop a robust object tracking neural network, to fetch 2D coordinates of the object; Develop a mathematical background for converting 2D representation into 3D.
